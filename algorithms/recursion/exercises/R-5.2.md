```cpp
bool rec_binary_search(int data[], int target, int low, int high) {
  if (low > high)
    return false;

  int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

  if (target == data[mid])
    return true;
  else if (target < data[mid])
    return rec_binary_search(data, target, low, mid - 1);
  else
    return rec_binary_search(data, target, mid + 1, high);
}
```

In order to return the index of the target in the sequence or -1
(if the target is not found) we have to return `mid` instead of `true`, if we
have found the target, or `-1` in the base case, if the target was not found.
